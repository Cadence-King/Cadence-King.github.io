The purpose of this expiriment is to see how well ChatGPT does in creating a basic 'vanilla' HTML website.   

As the attempts continue the guidance offered to ChatGPT went down. With each attempt the slate was wiped 
clean and a fresh chat was started. The idea of this is that there is no bias of ChatGPT due to previous chat 
ideas. However, this is not truely the case as ChatGPT is constantly taking in infomation from its userbase. 
With this in mind we may be able to see how ChatGPT could have improved over time.
