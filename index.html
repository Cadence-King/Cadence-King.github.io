    <h1>ChatGPT Expiriment</h1>
    <h2>By: Cadence King - cak0210</h2>

    <a href="https://github.com/Cadence-King/Cadence-King.github.io">Github</a>

    <P>
        The purpose of this expiriment is to see how well ChatGPT does in creating a basic 'vanilla' HTML website. 
        As the attempts continue the guidance offered to ChatGPT went down. With each attempt the slate was wiped 
        clean and a fresh chat was started. The idea of this is that there is no bias of ChatGPT due to previous chat 
        ideas. However, this is not truely the case as ChatGPT is constantly taking in infomation from its userbase. 
        With this in mind we may be able to see how ChatGPT could have improved over time.
    </P>

    <h4>Iterations:</h4>
    <ul>        
        <li><a href="FirstTry.html">First Attempt</a></li>

            <p>
            <li> Thoughts:</li>
                Was very surprised with how well ChatGPT did. It was also fun seeing what it would add.
                The result was 1 vanilla html document. I also prevented ChatGPT from using all the libraries and frameworks it wanted to.
                
                <p>
                The resulting site doesn't have much functionality, but it looks better than I expected. I think this is due to me asking it to use UNT colors and repeatedly asking for more stylization. 
                Though I tried to make my intro prompt clear, it was necessary to continue asking for more content to be added.
                The process was a bit tedious, despite it referencing previous prompts it would sometime decide to rewrite or omit previous sections, so most of my time was spent re-reading to see if it had changed anything.
                </p>
            
                <li> In the end we ended up with:</li>      
                <ul> 
                    <li>Header (title and menu bar)</li>
                    <li>Embedded YouTube video</li>
                    <li>Images (Interactable with grouped and individual bounding boxes)</li>
                    <li>Slideshow with text and images</li>
                    <li>Countdown</li>
                    <li>Embedded Google Maps (I changed to coordinates to UNT-DP)</li>
                    <li> Newsletter subscription box</li>
                    <li>'Contact Us' form</li>
                    <li>Customer Reviews</li>
                    <li>Footer</li>
                    <li>Color gradient animated background (which speeds up and down depending on scroll direction -not very noticeable)</li>
                </ul> 
            <p></p>      
            <li>Example Prompts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Hello, pretend you are a master web developer. Give me a full colorful website with lots of interactive elements. I want video, images, buttons, menus, and more. The website can be any topic you like. Please give me all of the files needed and outside links necessary."</li>
                    <li>"Continue adding more to the website."</li>
                    <li>"Give me some more colorful interactive elements a professional site would have."</li>
                    <li>"what else could be added?" - To which it gave 15 examples of what could be added. Since a few required outside libraries I asked it to add only a few otherwise it would have been a mess.</li>
                </ul>
           
            Since Chat GPT would omit/forget sections I also occasionally fed it back the full html document to set a new baseline.</li>

            This guided attempt did quite well, only missing 1 form label, having 1 suspicious link, and 1 youtube video.

                <li>Thoughts:</li>
                Improving on last time, instead of asking it to fix and re-do certain segments I allowed it to make mistakes 
                and not fill in all the details.   
                <p>
                Because I asked for so many elements it didn't fully flesh out each individual item like
                I allowed it to in the first attempt. This resulted in the few elements not turning out right. 
                </p>
                <li>Errors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interactive map isn't sized properly</li>
                    <li> Progress bar doesn't work</li>

                        but make sure it is vibrant. I want all of the code in 1 file."</li>
                        <li>"fill out the interactive map section with a google maps embed, also add much more to the site"</li>
                        <li> After this I just kept saying "add more elements"</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Comments:</li>
                When writing the first opening prompt I wanted to see how much could be done with just 1 message. 
                Because of how little ChatGPT did last attempt based off a vague first message, I felt had to give examples of some elements to get it started. 
                But even with all these example elements it still did not deliver all of the requests first try. 
                Also because I asked for so much at once it lacked any attention to detail so more mistakes were made.
                <p></p>
                <li>WAVE Accessibility Report</li>

                </ul>
                It did much worse than the last time on the accessibility report. I allowed it to use any color 
                scheme it wanted to which resulted in some low contrast ratio. 
                Because of this it did not meet WCAG requirements.
                Also, the scrolling text is a marquee element, which also results in an error.

                <li>Thoughts:</li>
                Looking back on the first two Attempts it was decided that I was guiding ChatGPT too much. With this 
                in mind my new goal was to provide as little direction as possible to ChatGPT
                This attempt went decently well. Despite my concerns about how well it would do, it actually went back and
                 revised previous sections of code. It seemingly jumped around at random to improve styling and elements 
                 it had left bare. It would add both scripts and CSS stylings to each previous elemenets on top of adding 
                 more. In the end I belive it interperited my prompt as building a modern sleek professional design, since
                the color scheme focuses on monochromatic grays.

                <p></p>
                <li>Example Prompts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You are a professional web developer, give me a stylish website with at least 10 elements of your choice"</li>
                    <li>"continue" x10</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <li>WAVE Accessability Report</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors: 4</li>
                    <li>Contrast Errors: 8</li>
                    <li>Alerts: 9</li>
                </ul>
                I believe the website scored so low due to the monochromatic nature of the end product, and the lack of images. We end up with 8 Contrast Errors, which is a major 
                problem as it leaves many sections unreadable This is as bad as "1.09:1".
                Other errors found are 4 "Misssing form label(s)" This is because ChatGPT utilized orphaned form labels, which count as alerts.
                The other errors are due to broken and/or suspicious links.

                <li>Thoughts:</li>
                This second attempt at the 'continue' method was a bit flawed. I only prompted ChatGPT to continue 5 times which doesnt allow for much 
                progress to be made. The reason I cut this attempt off early was due to my perceived problem with the starting prompt. 
                Firstly it was giving separate html, css, and js files. Secondly, it was creating an personal 'professional' website.
                Additionally, since the prompt was for a professional website, it again produced a monochromatic gray website. I found this 
                uninteresting so moved on quickly to the next attempt.
                <li>Example Prompts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You a professional web dev. Make a stylish website on a topic of your choice, with many interactive elements.</li>
                    <li>"continue" x5</li>
                </ul>

                <li>WAVE Accessability Report</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors: 1</li>
                    <li>Contrast Errors: 0</li>
                    <li>Alerts: 1</li>
                </ul>
                This attempt scored well only due to the lack of time. Given more time and elements added there would be a 
                greater number of errors found on the page. Additionally the attempt lacked any color or interesting visuals.
