    <h1>ChatGPT Expiriment</h1>

    <P>
        The purpose of this expiriment is to see how well ChatGPT does in creating a basic 'vanilla' HTML website. 
        As the attempts continue the guidance offered to ChatGPT went down. With each attempt the slate was wiped 
        clean and a fresh chat was started. The idea of this is that there is no bias of ChatGPT due to previous chat 
        ideas. However, this is not truely the case as ChatGPT is constantly taking in infomation from its userbase. 
        With this in mind we may be able to see how ChatGPT could have improved over time.

        <ul>
            <li> Thoughts:</li>
                <p>Was very surprised with how well ChatGPT did. It was also fun seeing what it would add.
                The result was 1 vanilla html document. I also prevented ChatGPT from using all the libraries and frameworks it wanted to.
                </p>
                <p>The resulting site doesn't have much functionality, but it looks better than I expected. I think this is due to me asking it to use UNT colors and repeatedly asking for more stylization. 
                Though I tried to make my intro prompt clear, it was necessary to continue asking for more content to be added.
                The process was a bit tedious, despite it referencing previous prompts it would sometime decide to rewrite or omit previous sections, so most of my time was spent re-reading to see if it had changed anything.
                </p>
            
                <li> In the end we ended up with:</li>      
                <ul> 
                    <li>Header (title and menu bar)</li>
                    <li>Embedded YouTube video</li>
                    <li>Images (Interactable with grouped and individual bounding boxes)</li>
                    <li>Slideshow with text and images</li>
                    <li>Countdown</li>
                    <li>Embedded Google Maps (I changed to coordinates to UNT-DP)</li>
                    <li> Newsletter subscription box</li>
                    <li>'Contact Us' form</li>
                    <li>Customer Reviews</li>
                    <li>Footer</li>
                    <li>Color gradient animated background (which speeds up and down depending on scroll direction -not very noticeable)</li>
                </ul> 
                                            
            <li>Some prompts were as follows:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Hello, pretend you are a master web developer. Give me a full colorful website with lots of interactive elements. I want video, images, buttons, menus, and more. The website can be any topic you like. Please give me all of the files needed and outside links necessary."</li>
                    <li>"Continue adding more to the website."</li>
                    <li>"Give me some more colorful interactive elements a professional site would have."</li>
                    <li>"what else could be added?" - To which it gave 15 examples of what could be added. Since a few required outside libraries I asked it to add only a few otherwise it would have been a mess.</li>
                </ul>
           <p> Since Chat GPT would omit/forget sections I also occasionally fed it back the full html document to set a new baseline.</li>

            <p>
                I started a fresh chat with ChatGPT, so it didn't take any information from before.
                Instead of asking it to fix and re-do certain segments I allowed it to make mistakes and not fill in all the details.
                
                Because I asked for so many elements it didn't fully flesh out each individual item like I allowed it to in the first attempt. This resulted in the few elements not turning out right. 
                For example:
                Interactive map isn't sized properly
                Progress bar doesn't work
                Dynamic pie chart doesn't work
                
                Some of the messages
                "Hello, pretend you are a professional web developer. I want you to give me a vanilla HTML website with a header, embedded video, images, buttons, menus, slides, embedded interactive map, footer, reviews and a form to send them. Use any color scheme you want, but make sure it is vibrant. I want all of the code in 1 file."
                "fill out the interactive map section with a google maps embed, also add much more to the site"
                After this I basically just kept saying "add more elements"
                
                Comments
                When writing the first opening prompt I wanted to see how much could be done with just 1 message. Because of how little ChatGPT did last attempt based off a vague first message, I felt had to give examples of some elements to get it started. 
                But even with all these example elements it still did not deliver all of the requests first try. Also because I asked for so much at once it lacked any attention to detail so more mistakes were made.
                
                WAVE Accessibility
                It did much worse than the last time on the accessibility report. I allowed it to use any color scheme it wanted to which resulted in some low contrast ratio. 
                Because of this it did not meet WCAG requirements.
                Also, the scrolling text is a marquee element, which also results in an error.
