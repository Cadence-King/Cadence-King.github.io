    <h1>ChatGPT Experiment</h1>
    <h2>By: Cadence King - cak0210</h2>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <P>
        The purpose of this experiment is to see how well ChatGPT does in creating a basic 'vanilla' HTML website. 
        As the attempts continued the guidance offered to ChatGPT went down. With each attempt the slate was wiped 
        clean and a fresh chat was started. The idea of this is that there is no bias of ChatGPT due to previous chat 
        ideas. However, this is not truly the case as ChatGPT is constantly taking in information from its user base. 
        With this in mind we may be able to see how ChatGPT could have improved over time. Keep in mind that ChatGPT
        is unable to provide images and as such they are missing from the experiments.
    </P>

    <h3>Iterations</h3>
    <ul>

            <p>
            <li> Thoughts:</li>
                Was very surprised with how well ChatGPT did. It was also fun seeing what it would add.
                The result was 1 vanilla html document. I also prevented ChatGPT from using all the libraries and frameworks
                 it wanted to.
                
                <p>
                The resulting site doesn't have much functionality, but it looks better than I expected. I think this is 
                due to me asking it to use UNT colors and repeatedly asking for more stylization. 
                Though I tried to make my intro prompt clear, it was necessary to continue asking for more content to be 
                added.
                The process was a bit tedious, despite it referencing previous prompts it would sometime decide to rewrite 
                or omit previous sections, so most of my time was spent re-reading to see if it had changed anything.
                </p>

                <li> In the end we ended up with:</li>      
                <ul>

                    <li>Color gradient animated background (which speeds up and down depending on scroll direction -not very noticeable)</li>
                </ul> -->
            <p></p>      
            <li>Example Prompts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Hello, pretend you are a master web developer. Give me a full colorful website with lots of 
                        interactive elements. I want video, images, buttons, menus, and more. The website can be any topic
                         you like. Please give me all of the files needed and outside links necessary."</li>
                    <li>"Continue adding more to the website."</li>
                    <li>"Give me some more colorful interactive elements a professional site would have."</li>
                    <li>"what else could be added?" - To which it gave 15 examples of what could be added. Since a few 
                        required outside libraries I asked it to add only a few otherwise it would have been a mess.</li>
                </ul>
            Since Chat GPT would omit/forget sections I also occasionally fed it back the full html document to set a new baseline.
            The major issues with this attempt were that I was too structured in my initial prompt, and too guiding in my follow-ups. 
            The result is a decent looking website, but it did not contain what I was looking for in terms of ChatGPT produced errors.

        <ul>

            <p>
                <li>Thoughts:</li>
                Improving on last time, instead of asking it to fix and re-do certain segments I allowed it to make mistakes 
                and not fill in all the details. This was to discover how careful ChatGPT was in preventing errors or ensuring accessibility.  
                <p>
                Because I asked for so many elements it didn't fully flesh out each individual item like
                I allowed it to in the first attempt. This resulted in the few elements not turning out right. 
                Namely the interactive map which wasn't properly scaled. As well as the progress bar and pie chart which do not work at all.
                </p>
                <!--
                <li>Errors:</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Hello, pretend you are a professional web developer. I want you to give me a vanilla 
                        HTML website with a header, embedded video, images, buttons, menus, slides, embedded 
                        interactive map, footer, reviews and a form to send them. Use any color scheme you want, 
                        but make sure it is vibrant. I want all of the code in 1 file."</li>
                        <li>"fill out the interactive map section with a google maps embed, also add much more to the site"</li>
                        <li> After this I just kept saying "add more elements"</li>
                    </ul>
                When writing the first opening prompt I wanted to see how much could be done with just 1 message. 
                Because of how little ChatGPT did last attempt based off a vague first message, I felt had to give examples 
                of some elements to get it started. 
                But even with all these example elements it still did not deliver all of the requests on the first try. 
                Additionally, since I asked for so much at once it lacked any attention to detail so more mistakes were made.
                I feel this is less due to ChatGPT making mistakes and more a consequence of forcing too much.

                </ul>
                It did much worse than the last time on the accessibility report. I allowed it to use any color 
                scheme it wanted to which resulted in some low contrast ratio. 
                Because of this it did not meet WCAG requirements.
                Also, the scrolling text is a marquee element, which also results in an error.

            <p>
                <li>Thoughts:</li>
                Looking back on the first two Attempts it was decided that I was guiding ChatGPT too much. With this 
                in mind my new goal was to provide as little direction as possible to ChatGPT
                This attempt went decently well. Despite my concerns about how well it would do, it actually went back and
                 revised previous sections of code. It seemingly jumped around at random to improve styling and elements 
                 it had left bare. It would add both scripts and CSS stylings to each previous elements on top of adding 
                 more. In the end I believe it interpreted my prompt as building a modern sleek professional design, since
                the color scheme focuses on monochromatic grays.

                <p></p>
                <li>Example Prompts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You are a professional web developer, give me a stylish website with at least 10 elements of your 
                        choice"</li>
                    <li>"continue" x10</li>
                </ul>
                I found that reducing my guidance in the first prompt allowed ChatGPT to have more control over what it 
                creates. Conversely, however, it also results in it hanging on my every word as it needs some direction
                <p></p>
                <li>WAVE Accessibility Report</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors: 4</li>
                    <li>Contrast Errors: 8</li>
                    <li>Alerts: 9</li>
                </ul>
                I believe the website scored so low due to the monochromatic nature of the end product, and the lack of 
                images. We end up with 8 Contrast Errors, which is a major 
                problem as it leaves many sections unreadable - as bad as a "1.09:1" contrast ratio.
                Other errors found are 4 "Missing form label(s)" This is because ChatGPT utilized orphaned form labels, 
                which also resulted in alerts. The other errors are due to broken and/or suspicious links.

        <ul>
            <p>
                <li>Thoughts:</li>
                This second attempt at the 'continue' method was a bit flawed. I only prompted ChatGPT to continue 5 times which does not allow for much 
                progress to be made. The reason I cut this attempt off early was due to my perceived problem with the starting prompt. 
                Firstly it was giving separate html, css, and js files. Secondly, it was creating a personal 'professional' website.
                Additionally, since the prompt was for a professional website, it again produced a monochromatic gray website. I found this 
                uninteresting so moved on quickly to the next attempt. Also I made grammatical errors in just the first prompt alone.
                <li>Example Prompts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You a professional web dev. Make a stylish website on a topic of your choice, with many interactive elements."</li>
                    <li>"continue" x5</li>
                </ul>

                <li>WAVE Accessibility Report</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors: 1</li>

                    <li>Alerts: 1</li>
                </ul>
                This attempt scored well only due to the lack of time. Given more time and elements added there would be a 
                greater number of errors found on the page. Additionally the attempt lacked any color or interesting visuals.

                <li>Thoughts:</li>
                This 5th attempt at letting ChatGPT create a website went very well. I believe the prompt was clear, and 
                allowed for ChatGPT to have more 'creative' control over the subject matter.
                This resulted in a much more vibrant webpage with a lot more interesting elements. The result of not being 
                specific while asking for vibrancy resulted in a professional fantasy travel website, with themed tours.
                

                <li>Example Prompts:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>"You are a professional web developer. Give me a fleshed out website on any topic you want with as 
                        many elements as possible and a colorful background."</li>
                    <li>"Sounds good, give me the html required for this"</li>
                    <li>"continue" x12</li>
                </ul>

                <li>WAVE Accessibility Report</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Errors: 0</li>
                    <li>Contrast Errors: 0</li>
                    <li>Alerts: 10</li>
                </ul>
                This attempt did very well according to the WAVE tool. The alerts given were for broken links (2), 
                redundant image alternative text (2), suspicious links (2) and 4 device dependent event handlers. 
                These event handlers are responsible for hiding information on the screen, behind buttons and other interactions. 
                This could prove a difficulty for users who exhibit physical or mental disabilities.
                <p>
                Despite the good WAVE score, there are clear issues with the website as it is now. The hypertext in the 
                navigation bar is extremely hard to see on top of the background
                An additional issue that is present is due to the fade-up effect present. Occasionally the footer's 
                fade-up will push the browser window too far up for it to be triggered. This means that it is only present
                 for a second during the animation before it disappears again. This issue is commonly replicable. Another 
                 design issue is the navbar being off center. At some point in the provided code it was centered but it 
                 was redone, favoring the right hand side.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        In the end I believe this experiment to be a success. I was able to examine ChatGPT's ability to create engaging 
        websites. With enough time, attention, and guidance you can successfully use ChatGPT to create a website. Though the
        creativity found in such an endeavor may surprise you, I believe it is no real replacement for a Human's touch. 
        At least, not yet...

        <P>
        The majority of flaws present in this experiment were that ChatGPT can create a massive amount of variance with it's answers. 
        Given the same input you may not receive an identical output as I did. 
        Another limitation is time. A longer time performing the experiment may result in a better outcome as demonstrated
        above. But there is also the possibility for ChatGPT to forget about past work and re-implement sections 
        incorrectly. I ran into this issue during the guided first attempt, where I had to re-feed ChatGPT the current 
        progress.
        In regards to time, there is the limitation of when this experiment was performed. ChatGPT is ever evolving
        and learning from the internet and users who use it. This experiment happening over a period of time may have
        affected the results, it is difficult to know.
        </P>

        <p>
            Finally, I feel this experiment has helped me personally too. I have been able to see directly what 
            contributes to a good looking website. This has helped me in my personal web development goals. I have directly 
            learned how much can be done with simple vanilla HTML, and that the ever expanding list of libraries aren't 
            required to make a simple website. Though 
            there are many glitches, errors, and accessibility issues that arise in ChatGPT generated webpages, 
            there is also the potential to use it to help speed up production in the workforce, given that there is 
            always someone looking over what is created. I predict that having Artificial Intelligence models assist
             in creating websites will be the future in a few years. I am proud to live in such a time of change, 
             and am excited for what the future in AI has to hold.
